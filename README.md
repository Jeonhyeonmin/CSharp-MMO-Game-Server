# üéÆ C# MMO Game Server Engine

Welcome! This repository contains a high-performance MMO game server engine built entirely from scratch in C#. This project is a deep dive into the core architecture of online game servers, translating complex theories into practical, high-performance code.

### Core Architecture at a Glance

This server's design is modular, focusing on the key pillars of MMO technology. Each system was built from the ground up to ensure efficiency and control.

| Core System             | Key Concepts Implemented                                                                                                                              | Purpose                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß† **Multithreading** | `SpinLock`, `ReaderWriterLock`, Custom Thread Management, `MemoryBarrier`, Deadlock Avoidance, `Thread Local Storage (TLS)`                            | To achieve maximum concurrency and performance on multi-core processors while ensuring data integrity.      |
| üåê **Networking** | Asynchronous `Socket` Programming, Session Management, Custom `Send/Recv` Ring Buffers, TCP `Listener` & `Connector`                                  | To handle thousands of simultaneous client connections with a non-blocking, low-latency I/O model.          |
| üì¶ **Packet Handling** | Custom Binary Serialization, Automated C# Code Generation from XML/JSON Packet Definitions                                                          | To create a highly efficient and error-free data protocol between the client and server.                    |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è **Concurrency & Jobs** | `Job Queue` System with a dedicated worker thread, Command Pattern, `Job Timer` for delayed execution                                                 | To serialize critical game logic (like world updates) in a single thread, avoiding complex synchronization. |
